        <p>Welcome to Testing Manager!</p>
        Testing manager will help you to handle testing mechanisms for your application faster, easier and more coviniently.
        <p>Basics</p>
        The application is able to create, edit and delete different test projects, components, test cases and test steps. You can build your project's structure for testing. Once you have done it, you can execute the test step by step. Later you are able to check the test results with the help of a chartpie. Also there is an auxiliary function which enables you to export your project or component into an Excel document.
        <p>Data Structure</p>
        The creatable data is well structured in the application. The highest level data unit is the <strong>project</strong>. The projects have their own name, a short, and a longer description. Latter is optional. Also projects should contain components, which are the next level data unit. Projects represent real life projects.<br>
        The previously mentioned <strong>components</strong> are one level below the projects. They represent some bigger parts of a project. They have name, description, author and version properties. In addition they contain testcases. <br>
        Below the components are the <strong>testcases</strong>. They are a smaller part of a project and a component. Like a login process. A testcase has name and description properties, and contains the test steps as well.<br>
        The <strong>steps</strong> are on the lowest level in the data structure. They are the smallest parts. If a test case is a login process, then a test step is the task to fill an input field. They have some propeties too, like the description, expected result, order number and also an optional comment.
        <p>User interface</p>
        The UI has two main components. On the left side there is the project list. This part is always present. You can see the existing projects and select the desired one. Above the list there is a button for creating new projects. After clicking on this button a modal window will appear and you can define the parameters of the new project. Please take note that there are some validations in the background, so if the alert window warns you that there is a problem, obey the commands. Also an alert warns if the creation process was successfull or has failed.<br>
        On the right side there is the details page. This unit contains the most avalaible functions and details. If you select a project from the project list, it will appear in the details page. The page has a header bar that contains the name of the selected unit and its type. Also on the right there are the buttons which represent the available functions with the current unit. Below you can find the details of the selected unit, and at the bottom there is the list of the contained lower level units.<br>
        If you choose a lower level unit like a component, it will load instead of the project into the the details page. The same will happen in the case of cases and steps. <br>
        If you want to edit your units, the edit mechanisms works the same like the creation. A modal window will appear and you just have to modify the properties. In case of delete, there will be a confirm window, just to make sure you really want to delete the current unit.<br>
        There is a useful way the change quickly the steps' order number. You can use a drag and drop way to change the steps.
        <p>Executing tests</p>
        If you have already build your data structure then you are ready to test it. You can only use test on component level. In order to do it you should open a component. Note that you should have testcases and test steps inside the component to create a valid test. Select <i>Test</i> button in the header.<br>
        The test page will load into the details page. At once only one case's content will be loaded. You have to set a status and an optional comment to <i>every</i> step in order to be able to continue with the next case. If you are ready with every step, you should click on the <i>Next Case</i> button to jump onto the next test case. If you reach the last case, the <i>Finish Test</i> button will appear. With this you can completely finish your test. The results will be saved.
        <p>Test Results</p>
        You can check the test results of each component on the component details page. Click on the <i>Results</i> button and if the component has valid component results, you should see them listed in the details page. If you select one of them, then a piechart will be shown where you can see the number of the different statuses represented in the chart. If you are done you can go back to the component with the <i>Back</i> buttons.
        <p>Excel Export</p>
        You can export projects and components into an Excel document. All you have to do is click on the <i>Export</i> button on their details pages. Note that you should export units only if they contain testcases and test steps. The name of the document will be the name of the project or the component. In addition, the first sheet in the document will contain information about the main unit itself.
